# How many shapes are there?
This is an easy game for first graders. Two people play this game together. One will change the number of shapes, or the shapes, and one will try to count how many shapes are there.

# Ideas for improvement:
I want to use this source code and train a Convolutional neural network to count how many shapes there are
